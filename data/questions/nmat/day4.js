      passage: `Like Charles Darwin, Alfred Wegener revolutionized an entire science. Unlike Darwin's ideas, which still stir up much controversy, Wegener's theory of drifting continents is accepted almost without question, but it did not succeed without a struggle.
  
  In 1912 Wegener suggested that Africa and South America are estranged pieces of a single, ancient supercontinent, Pangaea, that had drifted apart, leaving the Atlantic Ocean between them. However, even Wegener believed that geological wear and tear over the ages would have damaged the fine detail of ancient coastlines, destroying the best evidence for drift. He never tested the fit between African and South American coastlines with any exactitude, and for a time his ideas were virtually ignored. In 1924 Harold Jeffreys, who would become one of the strongest critics of the theory, dismissed it in his landmark book The Earth. Apparently after casually observing the shorelines on a globe, Jeffreys concluded that the fit between Africa and South America was very poor.
  
  Disturbed by Jeffreys' obviously perfunctory observation, S. W. Carey used careful techniques of geometric proportion to correct, better than most maps do, for the fact that the continents' margins lie on a sphere rather than on a flat surface. He found a remarkably close fit. At about the same time, Keith Runcorn found other evidence for drift. When volcanic lava cools and hardens into basalt, it is magnetized by the earth's own magnetic field. The rock's poles become aligned with the earth's magnetic poles. Though the Planet's poles have wandered over the past few hundred million years, the magnetic field of each basalt garment is still aligned the way the earth's poles were at the rime the rock was formed. Although one would expect that the magnetic fields of rocks of the same age from any continent would all be aligned the same way the earth's magnetic field was aligned at that time, the magnetic fields of basalts in North America are now aligned quite differently from rocks formed in the same epoch in Europe. Thus, the rocks provided clear evidence that the continents had drifted with respect to each other. True to form, Jeffreys brusquely rejected Runcorn's studies. His casual disdain for such observational data led some field geologists to suggest that his classic should be retitled An Earth.
  
  In 1966 compelling proof that the seafloor spreads from the midocean ridges confirmed the hypothesis that molten rock wells up at these ridges from deep within the earth and repaves the seafloor as giant crustal plates move apart. Thus, seafloor spreading not only explained the long-standing puzzle of why the ocean basins are so much younger than the continents, but also provided evidence that the plates, and so the continents on them, move. Overnight, plate tectonic theory, with continental drift, became the consensus view.`,

      passage: `While the most abundant and dominant species within a particular ecosystem is often crucial in perpetuating the ecosystem, a "\"keystone\" species, here defined as one whose effects are much larger than would be predicted from its abundance, can also play a vital role. But because complex species interactions may be involved, identifying a keystone species by removing the species and observing changes in the ecosystem is problematic. It might seem that certain traits would clearly define a species as a keystone species; for example, Pisaster ochraceus is often a keystone predator because it consumes and suppresses mussel populations, which in the absence of this starfish can be a dominant species. But such predation on a dominant or potentially dominant species occurs in systems that do as well as in systems that do not have species that play keystone roles. Moreover, whereas P. ochraceus occupies an unambiguous keystone role on wave-exposed rocky headlands, in more wave-sheltered habitats the impact of P. ochraceus predation is weak or nonexistent, and at certain sites sand burial is responsible for eliminating mussels. Keystone status appears to depend on context, whether of particular geography or of such factors as community diversity (for example, a reduction in species diversity may thrust more of the remaining species into keystone roles) and length of species interaction (since newly arrived species in particular may dramatically affect ecosystems).`,

This directly links the sheltered nature of the habitat (degree to which it is sheltered from waves) to the diminished role of P. ochraceus. Options (B), (C), (D), and (E) are not directly supported by the passage as factors affecting the keystone role of P. ochraceus in different habitats. The passage mentions predation on dominant species but doesn't focus on other animals preying on mussels (B), nor does it state that mussel populations are *often* not dominant (C). The size of P. ochraceus population (D) or great species diversity (E) are not cited as reasons for the *difference* in its keystone role across habitats, although diversity is mentioned as a factor influencing keystone status generally.`,

      passage: `While the most abundant and dominant species within a particular ecosystem is often crucial in perpetuating the ecosystem, a "\"keystone\" species, here defined as one whose effects are much larger than would be predicted from its abundance, can also play a vital role. But because complex species interactions may be involved, identifying a keystone species by removing the species and observing changes in the ecosystem is problematic. It might seem that certain traits would clearly define a species as a keystone species; for example, Pisaster ochraceus is often a keystone predator because it consumes and suppresses mussel populations, which in the absence of this starfish can be a dominant species. But such predation on a dominant or potentially dominant species occurs in systems that do as well as in systems that do not have species that play keystone roles. Moreover, whereas P. ochraceus occupies an unambiguous keystone role on wave-exposed rocky headlands, in more wave-sheltered habitats the impact of P. ochraceus predation is weak or nonexistent, and at certain sites sand burial is responsible for eliminating mussels. Keystone status appears to depend on context, whether of particular geography or of such factors as community diversity (for example, a reduction in species diversity may thrust more of the remaining species into keystone roles) and length of species interaction (since newly arrived species in particular may dramatically affect ecosystems).`,

Option (B) is explicitly stated as problematic by the author.
