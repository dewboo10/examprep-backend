    paragraph: `While the most abundant and dominant species within a particular ecosystem is often crucial in perpetuating the ecosystem, a \\\"keystone\\\" species, here defined as one whose effects are much larger than would be predicted from its abundance, can also play a vital role. But because complex species interactions may be involved, identifying a keystone species by removing the species and observing changes in the ecosystem is problematic. It might seem that certain traits would clearly define a species as a keystone species; for example, Pisaster ochraceus is often a keystone predator because it consumes and suppresses mussel populations, which in the absence of this starfish can be a dominant species. But such predation on a dominant or potentially dominant species occurs in systems that do as well as in systems that do not have species that play keystone roles. Moreover, whereas P. ochraceus occupies an unambiguous keystone role on wave-exposed rocky headlands, in more wave-sheltered habitats the impact of P. ochraceus predation is weak or nonexistent, and at certain sites sand burial is responsible for eliminating mussels. Keystone status appears to depend on context, whether of particular geography or of such factors as community diversity (for example, a reduction in species diversity may thrust more of the remaining species into keystone roles) and length of species interaction (since newly arrived species in particular may dramatically affect ecosystems).`,

    paragraph: `While the most abundant and dominant species within a particular ecosystem is often crucial in perpetuating the ecosystem, a \\\"keystone\\\" species, here defined as one whose effects are much larger than would be predicted from its abundance, can also play a vital role. But because complex species interactions may be involved, identifying a keystone species by removing the species and observing changes in the ecosystem is problematic. It might seem that certain traits would clearly define a species as a keystone species; for example, Pisaster ochraceus is often a keystone predator because it consumes and suppresses mussel populations, which in the absence of this starfish can be a dominant species. But such predation on a dominant or potentially dominant species occurs in systems that do as well as in systems that do not have species that play keystone roles. Moreover, whereas P. ochraceus occupies an unambiguous keystone role on wave-exposed rocky headlands, in more wave-sheltered habitats the impact of P. ochraceus predation is weak or nonexistent, and at certain sites sand burial is responsible for eliminating mussels. Keystone status appears to depend on context, whether of particular geography or of such factors as community diversity (for example, a reduction in species diversity may thrust more of the remaining species into keystone roles) and length of species interaction (since newly arrived species in particular may dramatically affect ecosystems).`,

    options: [
      "(A) A species of bat is primarily responsible for keeping insect populations within an ecosystem low, and the size of the insect population in turn affects bird species within that ecosystem.No reflection of a particular geography, community diversity or length of species interaction.",

    correctAnswer: "(B) A species of iguana occupies a keystone role on certain tropical islands, but does not play that role on adjacent tropical islands that are inhabited by a greater number of animal species.",
    explanation: `Option (B) is correct because the last sentence of the passage states: \\\"Keystone status appears to depend on context, whether of particular geography or of such factors as community diversity... and length of species interaction\\\". Option (B) directly supports the \\\"community diversity\\\" aspect, showing that the keystone role of the iguana changes based on the diversity of other species in adjacent islands. Options (A), (C), (D), and (E) do not clearly support the idea that keystone status depends on context, geography, community diversity, or length of species interaction as discussed in the last sentence.`,

    question: "The passage suggests which of the following about the identification of a species as a keystone species?",
    options: [
      "(A) Such an identification depends primarily on the species\\\' relationship to the dominant species.",
      "(B) Such an identification can best be made by removing the species from a particular ecosystem and observing changes that occur in the ecosystem. Author mentioned this method is problematic.",
      "(C) Such an identification is likely to be less reliable as an ecosystem becomes less diverse.",
      "(D) Such an identification seems to depend on various factors within the ecosystem.",
      "(E) Such an identification can best be made by observing predation behavior. Predation behavior also occurs in systems that do not have keystones."
    ],
    answerIndex: 3,
    correctAnswer: "(D) Such an identification seems to depend on various factors within the ecosystem.",
    explanation: `Option (D) is correct because the passage concludes by stating, \\\"Keystone status appears to depend on context, whether of particular geography or of such factors as community diversity... and length of species interaction\\\". This clearly indicates that various factors within the ecosystem influence the identification of a keystone species. Option (A) is incorrect because while relationship to dominant species is mentioned, the passage also indicates that predation on dominant species occurs in systems without keystone roles, and other factors influence keystone status. Option (B) is explicitly stated as problematic by the author. Option (C) is the opposite of what the passage implies about diversity (a reduction in diversity may *thrust more* species into keystone roles, not make identification less reliable). Option (E) is incorrect because the passage notes that predation behavior can occur in systems that do not have keystone roles.`,
